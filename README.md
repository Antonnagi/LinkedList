If a binary search tree (BST) is not balanced, how long could it take in the worst case to find an item?

time complexity to find an item in the tree would be O(n)

8
What would be the worst case if we are looking for a value in a binary tree (Binary Tree - BT) that is not ordered

 worst-case time complexity would be O(n),
